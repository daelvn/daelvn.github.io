  I WANT TO CREATE<br>
  BUT I DESTROY EVERYTHING<br>
  THAT COMES TO MY MIND<br>
  <br>
  PERHAPS YELLING IS THE ONLY<br>
  THING THAT CANNOT BE FILTERED<br>
  I WANT TO ESCAPE<br>
  <br>
  I WILL CREATE<br>
  NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRY TO STOP MYSELF<br>
  BECAUSE I AM BOUND TO GIVE TO THE WORLD<br>
  <br>
  I WILL CREATE<br>
  BECAUSE I CANNOT REATAIN MY FEELINGS<br>
  FOR MUCH MORE TIME<br>
  <br>
  I WILL CREATE<br>
  BECAUSE EVERYTHING I DO DESERVES<br>
  TO BE SEEN AND APPRECIATED<br>
  <br>
  I WILL CREATE<br>
  BECAUSE I AM MY OWN CREATION<br>
  I AM A GOD TO MYSELF<br>
  <br>
  I WILL GET RID OF ALL MY FILTERS<br>
  I WILL STOP CARING ABOUT OTHERS' OPINION<br>
  I WILL DESTROY DESTRUCTION FOREVER<br>
  <br>
  I WILL CREATE A BETTER ME<br>
  I WILL CREATE THE BEST OF ME<br>
  I WILL MAKE MY EXISTENCE ART<br>
  <br>
  I AM CREATION<br>
  AND CREATION IS ART<br>
  I WILL NOT BE BOUND TO A SINGLE CANVAS<br>
  <br>
  I WILL CREATE FOR MYSELF<br>
  OPINIONS ARE A CONSEQUENCE<br>
