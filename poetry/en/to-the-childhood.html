<p align="center">
Golden stars in a violet sky,</p>
Victorian dressing tables filled with precious jewelry,</p>
the distant sound of a music box</p>
that moves my hand writing this poem.</p>
</p>
A lot of wooden toys in some house in my town,</p>
it has a chimney and in the sofa he leaves my gifts,</p>
Santa Claus, when he visits me</p>
in my eternal Christmas and youth.</p>
</p>
And all the places are full of lights and trees</p>
with ornaments in garnet and gold, a lot of rag dolls,</p>
hand-made by little elves</p>
who work for me to be happy.</p>
</p>
The sky is painted with watercolor, navy</p>
blues and purples, stars that shine</p>
more than ever in the city</p>
that gazes at them.</p>
</p>
And in my bed there are freshly laundered sheets</p>
in green and decorated with trains</p>
that carry me to my dreams every night</p>
and take me back to remember.</p>
</p>
And all my plushes are there, all of them</p>
have their name and heart, all of them are with me</p>
and sing me a lullaby so</p>
that tomorrow the sun will rise.</p>
</p>
But I do not get sleepy</p>
so I talk to them and they tell me</p>
all of their adventures and all of their travels</p>
and I smile thoughtfully while they talk to me.</p>
</p>
And the chimney, its warm fire illuminates</p>
the furniture that smells like wood from</p>
my bed. And the angels with immense wings</p>
tuck me in my bed and sing another lullaby.</p>
</p>
And I know all of the songs and I</p>
whisper them while they sing.</p>
And my eyelids close slowly until</p>
I wake up and it is a new day.</p>
</p>
And there are still wooden toys,</p>
and interesting books, and stories to get lost in,</p>
and many music boxes that tell me stories,</p>
while I spend the afternoon in my pajamas.</p>
