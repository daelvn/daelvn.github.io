<p align="center">
Golden stars in a violet sky,<br>
Victorian dressing tables filled with precious jewelry,<br>
the distant sound of a music box<br>
that moves my hand writing this poem.<br>
<br>
A lot of wooden toys in some house in my town,<br>
it has a chimney and in the sofa he leaves my gifts,<br>
Santa Claus, when he visits me<br>
in my eternal Christmas and youth.<br>
<br>
And all the places are full of lights and trees<br>
with ornaments in garnet and gold, a lot of rag dolls,<br>
hand-made by little elves<br>
who work for me to be happy.<br>
<br>
The sky is painted with watercolor, navy<br>
blues and purples, stars that shine<br>
more than ever in the city<br>
that gazes at them.<br>
<br>
And in my bed there are freshly laundered sheets<br>
in green and decorated with trains<br>
that carry me to my dreams every night<br>
and take me back to remember.<br>
<br>
And all my plushes are there, all of them<br>
have their name and heart, all of them are with me<br>
and sing me a lullaby so<br>
that tomorrow the sun will rise.<br>
<br>
But I do not get sleepy<br>
so I talk to them and they tell me<br>
all of their adventures and all of their travels<br>
and I smile thoughtfully while they talk to me.<br>
<br>
And the chimney, its warm fire illuminates<br>
the furniture that smells like wood from<br>
my bed. And the angels with immense wings<br>
tuck me in my bed and sing another lullaby.<br>
<br>
And I know all of the songs and I<br>
whisper them while they sing.<br>
And my eyelids close slowly until<br>
I wake up and it is a new day.<br>
<br>
And there are still wooden toys,<br>
and interesting books, and stories to get lost in,<br>
and many music boxes that tell me stories,<br>
while I spend the afternoon in my pajamas.<br>
