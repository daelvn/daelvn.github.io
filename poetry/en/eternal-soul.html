<p align="center">
heaven is lonely<br>
when there is only you to share it.<br>
where are all the people?<br>
where are all the promises?<br>
<br>
it pours down in earth<br>
and it is the first rain<br>
that my body won't be able<br>
to touch, to feel, to cry<br>
<br>
and when i look to the forest,<br>
everything is flooded, lost,<br>
but that doesn't matter now,<br>
and i don't think it ever did.<br>
<br>
i don't know what to do<br>
now that all i've got is myself.<br>
i'm not used to the feeling,<br>
even my body has changed.<br>
<br>
i can finally feel the teeth<br>
that bite sharply and fiercely.<br>
i can finally feel the wings<br>
that fly far from here.<br>
<br>
but i'm empty with noone<br>
by my side, so empty.<br>
it's almost like a piece of me<br>
is simply gone and missing.<br>
<br>
and i wonder if He felt the same<br>
when He chose me, empty.<br>
i wonder what drove Him to me,<br>
to my heart and my forest.<br>
<br>
would i climb to the pinnacle of hypocrisy?<br>
would i use my consciousness<br>
to further instigate the empty promises<br>
of a salvation that is never coming?<br>
<br>
no, i'm not like that angel,<br>
i'm much better than that.<br>
i'm what He would have wanted,<br>
i'm the next in the chain.<br>
<br>
but why, in a world set free of rules,<br>
and liberated from all humanity,<br>
would i decide to be pure?<br>
i don't know how to answer.<br>
<br>
but i am, and that's what matters,<br>
this is why i was elevated for,<br>
this is my purpose,<br>
my path, my rain, my fall.<br>
<br>
whatever i was born for, it is<br>
not from earth, it is here,<br>
here is where my memory will last<br>
and here is where i will perform.<br>
<br>
i tried so many times down there,<br>
but i simply couldn't connect:<br>
a broken angel breaks people,<br>
corrupted angels corrupt mortals.<br>
<br>
i can go back again, finally,<br>
but in a different form, i understand.<br>
i am no mere mortal anymore,<br>
i have found my purpose.<br>
<br>
i am the angel with the whitest wings<br>
i am no other than the Fourth.<br>
