<p align="center">
Sing to the night,<br>
sing to the moon,<br>
be the new angel<br>
that guards my cradle.<br>
<br>
I wish I had counted<br>
all the dreams<br>
that you guided me through<br>
when we were younger.<br>
<br>
Your melody continued<br>
to resonate in my head,<br>
when I had to cry<br>
at night, silently.<br>
<br>
But one day you got lost<br>
and I couldn't find you again.<br>
You were spinning in my head<br>
and one day I lost track.<br>
<br>
You were art so I left,<br>
and worldwide I searched for you.<br>
Where are you, my angel?<br>
Even to Italy I will go.<br>
<br>
And when I found you<br>
I broke in tears,<br>
I hugged you and told you<br>
that in my pocket you would be safe.<br>
<br>
Now when I listen<br>
and I do it carefully,<br>
I still hear your voice,<br>
glorious in my mind.<br>
<br>
But you are a soul<br>
and in my head you're present.<br>
</p>
