<p align="center">
Driving away,<br>
none to little faith.<br>
Stars that will light my face,<br>
blades that will cry my death.<br>
<br>
I feel alone,<br>
I'm all alone...<br>
<br>
Friends I go out with.<br>
Confidence, it's all a myth.<br>
<br>
I feel my heart.<br>
Can you feel it now?<br>
<br>
One more mile, one more mile<br>
and I'll be out.<br>
Let's not be loud.<br>
<br>
One more mile, one more mile<br>
to see the day,<br>
or to fade away.<br>
<br>
Things to be undone,<br>
just a mile more.<br>
<br>
Make up your mind.<br>
Is this my heart?<br>
<br>
Feelings that can't be parsed,<br>
a ground that's so coarse.<br>
<br>
I've lost my head,<br>
a war was led.<br>
<br>
Nothing feels real,<br>
I'm the one he wants to kill.<br>
<br>
I pour my thoughts,<br>
can you see it now?<br>
<br>
One more mile, one more mile<br>
and I'll be out.<br>
Let's not be loud.<br>
<br>
One more mile, one more mile<br>
to see the day,<br>
or to fade away.<br>
<br>
A heart that skips a beat,<br>
a brain that thinks of me.<br>
<br>
It's all I need,<br>
just someone here.<br>
<br>
// I see the exit //<br>
// I drive out //<br>
// Not my place //<br>
// Not my heart //<br>
// They tore it apart //<br>
// They tore me apart //<br>
<br>
One more mile, one more mile<br>
and I'll be out.<br>
Let's not be loud.<br>
<br>
One more mile, one more mile<br>
to see the day,<br>
or to fade away.<br>
