<p align="center">
Walk under the starry<br>
night and ask him:<br>
What is above you<br>
if you do not know it?<br>
<br>
Breathe the fresh and<br>
humid air of the forest.<br>
Who guides your steps<br>
towards the unfortunate disembarkation?<br>
<br>
Touch their ghost and<br>
feel the shivers.<br>
Who guides your heart,<br>
powerful so silently?<br>
<br>
Homing pigeon,<br>
do not listen to the message.<br>
Do you not know how much it hurts<br>
to die in this landscape?<br>
<br>
Weapon of two,<br>
one-sided dagger.<br>
Pick it with your hands,<br>
cover the blood with thread.<br>
<br>
They say there are two<br>
but you only see one.<br>
The other for you<br>
is made of clothes and rags.<br>
<br>
Run, go and tell them before it is too late,<br>
that I guide my steps and they guide my heart.<br>
