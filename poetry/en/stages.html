<p align="center">
  <br>Start of the day:
  <br>I don't want to die
  <br>but I never want to try.
  <br>They say destiny is mine,
  <br>but why would I ever wanna say goodbye?
  <br>
  <br>An art piece, a masterpiece
  <br>that some say it's me,
  <br>always up for going there,
  <br>never down to be here.
  <br>
  <br>Could be walking down the streets,
  <br>visit the place I want to leave.
  <br>Just want to die somewhere else,
  <br>I'm really such a mess.
  <br>
  <br>Somewhere I would rather be
  <br>is something you all can dream.
  <br>Identity as a sin,
  <br>destruction: incomplete.
  <br>
  <br>Shivers take my spine,
  <br>all my fears, they're combined.
  <br>A poem in a frame,
  <br>someone thinks it's lame.
  <br>
  <br>Achievements, finish lanes,
  <br>a race that never ends,
  <br>a future that never bends,
  <br>I can't ever find my friends.
  <br>
  <br>Broken poets, blank poems,
  <br>empty words in this mode and
  <br>will you find the code?
  <br>To my prison, 101 is the node
  <br>that connects it all,
  <br>pictures in this hall,
  <br>a hole in my wall,
  <br>that my heart used to escape the cage,
  <br>avoid decay, broken veins,
  <br>the mind that wanted fame,
  <br>boxed in a frame, always the same
  <br>I say
  <br>
  <br>Second verse:
  <br>
  <br>I don't want to feel,
  <br>stuck in the loop, "it's not real".
  <br>If I would have myself,
  <br>I would have someone to kill.
  <br>
  <br>Sometimes all things, others nothing,
  <br>never something, makes you think.
  <br>I haven't had a drink,
  <br>I still believe in dreams.
  <br>
  <br>Am I still a kid,
  <br>or am I allowed to leave?
  <br>Don't take my life away
  <br>just take it from him.
  <br>
  <br>There's the line,
  <br>it's not mine.
  <br>Unallowed to decide,
  <br>I never take pride.
  <br>
  <br>Counting down each verse,
  <br>a text that is so terse.
  <br>"Must be something but it's nothing,
  <br>so I just go back to bed".
  <br>
  <br>Crying in the floor,
  <br>noone opened the door.
  <br>Meanwhile someone gets poor
  <br>and we say it's a small world.
  <br>
  <br>Finding hope in songs,
  <br>that talk about the Lord.
  <br>Do I really believe in
  <br>someone else but my mom?
  <br>
  <br>She's there, just asleep,
  <br>can't feel anything but my limbs,
  <br>I shaved the other day,
  <br>an order to take away.
  <br>
  <br>Preparation to start your day,
  <br>but never help to finish them.
  <br>Hoping for a new sun,
  <br>I just feel so down
  <br>
  <br>By the end of the day...
