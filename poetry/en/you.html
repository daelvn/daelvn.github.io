<p align="center">
thinking about you wears me down<br>
and i feel like i melt with the sheets of my bed<br>
when i think you’re by my side<br>
<br>
i’ve been destroying myself to find you in all of this<br>
placing my arms under a razor blade<br>
to find out if you’re under my skin<br>
<br>
maybe if i break my carbon frame enough<br>
i’ll find my peace<br>
i’ll find you<br>
</p>
