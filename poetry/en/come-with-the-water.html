<p align="center">
the stars weren't as bright<br>
as you weren't by my side.<br>
my skin didn't feel calm<br>
as you stayed in your mind.<br>
<br>
i got to sing the song that i'd written<br>
but you weren't there to hear it.<br>
i got to cry the tears that i'd save<br>
but you weren't there to soothe them.<br>
<br>
i wish... i had... a piece... of you...<br>
i wish... i had... told you... in time...<br>
<br>
but i won't ever find you<br>
and i won't ever love you<br>
<br>
we were born in the wild<br>
and in the wild we wil die<br>
<br>
and i can't ever see you<br>
each time that you die<br>
<br>
we were found in the woods<br>
and in the woods we will cry<br>
<br>
i'll let you tie me down,<br>
trap me, break me,<br>
let's go wild<br>
<br>
it is about all your feral love,<br>
burn me, leash me,<br>
let's burn it all<br>
<br>
come with the water<br>
come with the water<br>
<br>
here, in my palm, i got something for you.<br>
it is, just a thought, but i save it always dearly.<br>
take, it from me, you can have it always granted.<br>
make, one for me, and i'll place it in my mind<br>
<br>
and i won't ever find you<br>
and i won't ever love you<br>
<br>
we were born in the wild<br>
and in the wild we will die<br>
<br>
and i can't ever see you<br>
each time that you die<br>
<br>
we were found in the woods<br>
and in the woods we will cry<br>
<br>
come with the water<br>
come with the water<br>
come with the water<br>
come with the water<br>
<br>
shed... a tear...<br>
and come with the water<br>
