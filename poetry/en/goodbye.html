<p align="center">
rain, rain and more rain.<br>
what would it be of my body,<br>
buried in a mossy tombstone,<br>
without water that washes my sin.<br>
<br>
and my phantom would wander<br>
that eternal and autumnal forest,<br>
even if it's only once again,<br>
from the beginning to the end.<br>
<br>
i would wake from my grave<br>
to walk for the last time<br>
to the stream of the freshest water<br>
that my hands had ever touched.<br>
<br>
it leads to a small lake<br>
surrounded by no more than spruce and stone,<br>
with a row boat,<br>
to end up as far as possible.<br>
<br>
i guide myself through the mist<br>
using the voices that have always called me.<br>
if i don't see you anymore in earth<br>
i hope that this is my destiny.<br>
<br>
because there's no place more silent,<br>
no fresher air,<br>
no calmer soul<br>
than mine in this place.<br>
<br>
back to the forest, i take the path.<br>
i know where it will take me<br>
but i walk it as if<br>
i had never stepped on it before.<br>
<br>
and my already ethereal body<br>
would present itself there,<br>
in front of the cabin<br>
that appears in all of my dreams.<br>
<br>
preserved wood with a<br>
small porch, it is enough.<br>
i sit in the rocker bench<br>
singing songs in my mind.<br>
<br>
it's a homely cabin, it is small,<br>
but it has all i need:<br>
to be alone and, for the last time,<br>
in peace with my rested soul.<br>
<br>
my eyes would see for the last time<br>
this place destined for me.<br>
oh, how will i miss the views<br>
to my small garden.<br>
<br>
and through one of the windows<br>
i can see giant mountains<br>
covered in trees and mist<br>
of my same transparency.<br>
<br>
i might have left behind my body<br>
but i know the raindrops will still calm my soul,<br>
even if it's just one,<br>
just one last time.<br>
<br>
and i would sleep in that bed<br>
surrounded by you, listening to your voice<br>
to leave you forever,<br>
even if it's not what i promised.<br>
<br>
i would gaze at everything amazed,<br>
the beauty of nature,<br>
and my soul in its purest state.<br>
i leave you behind, my dear.<br>
<br>
and with my last breath i go back to my eternal resting place.<br>
goodbye, it was a pleasure to meet you.<br>
