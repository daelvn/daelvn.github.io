<p align="center">
the febrile neon lights chase me<br>
suffocate me in your eyes<br>
let them shine in the rain<br>
cover me in your mind<br>
be the natural light in the artifice<br>
<br>
fall your thunder over my soul<br>
be my god and give me wings<br>
let me reach you in the peak of the possible<br>
<br>
rain your truth over my lie<br>
be my judge and revoke my sense<br>
make me see i dont own you<br>
<br>
the febrile neon lights chase me<br>
wash me in your word, let it reach me<br>
tell me you can love me but dont fulfill it<br>
