<h1 align="center">time does not heal but being alone does</h1><br>
<p align="center">
i hope you're happy with the<br>
path that you've taken<br>
because oh, i know you are.<br>
i am your only game.<br>
<br>
it was into may when<br>
you decided you got bored,<br>
and needed something<br>
for the sake of your own entertainment.<br>
<br>
i'm growing stronger<br>
with every single minute that passes.<br>
and i refuse to be your angel,<br>
not your savior anymore.<br>
<br>
you won't entice me with<br>
any carefully crafted words<br>
that you may have for me.<br>
no apology will save you now.<br>
<br>
you had been abusing me,<br>
manipulating me, and got me<br>
to believe things i just can't<br>
believe ever came out of my hands.<br>
<br>
so stop trying to appeal to<br>
my known weaknesses,<br>
to the things i used to enjoy<br>
and you destroyed for me.<br>
<br>
you don't deserve any<br>
more affection from me,<br>
so i will die as soon as possible,<br>
just as you told me.<br>
<br>
i don't care what you have,<br>
it was eating me inside,<br>
it was killing me not for<br>
you to pretend i'm healed now.<br>
<br>
you ruined romance for me<br>
i'm that stupid useless scumbag<br>
you hate so much.<br>
choke on your own words.<br>
<br>
[unfinished]<br>

[and if someone's reading this, i simply couldn't continue]<br>
[it's not my first language, and my mind is all a mess]<br>
[i just can't write anything coherent about this right now]<br>
[i still need time to process]<br>
[but if you did read it, thank you so much]<br>
