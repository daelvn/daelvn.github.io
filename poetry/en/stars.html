"Homing pigeon, tell me all"<br>
"Why she doesn't love me so?"<br>
"Try again for me, just go"<br>
"Where did I go wrong?"<br>
<br>
Your blood painted the moon red.<br>
The symbol of the lovers stained with death.<br>
A look so cruel, bulletproof,<br>
but you weren't.<br>
<br>
But you weren't.<br>
<br>
// They shot one down but we were there for you. //<br>
// Gunshot wounded, howling at the moon. //<br>
// A night so clear, a moon so red. //<br>
// Stars. //<br>
<br>
"Homing pigeon, tell me all"<br>
"Why can't she just love me so?"<br>
"Will I get well tomorrow?"<br>
"It just takes courage"<br>
<br>
You were angry, showing teeth,<br>
them so sharp and you were hungry.<br>
"There's no food", you said bluntly,<br>
and you felt scared.<br>
<br>
You felt scared.<br>
<br>
// You hit the wall and shouted at the cruel. //<br>
// The sound of music hunted you for good. //<br>
// We were alone, I told you, "look". //<br>
// Stars. //<br>
<br>
We sat down against the wall,<br>
all your friends started to come.<br>
There's some demons that won't go,<br>
you had bloodthirst.<br>
<br>
I told you to look at the sky.<br>
There was no light but there were stars.<br>
You lost control and I saw<br>
the calm that's coming.<br>
<br>
The calm that's coming.<br>
<br>
// You felt the purple that I built for you //<br>
// Watch the big dipper, in a ground so smooth //<br>
// I wish that I could've held your hand //<br>
// Stars. Stars. //<br>
