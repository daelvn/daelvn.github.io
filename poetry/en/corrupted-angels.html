<p align="center">
Your wings are broken, angel,<br>
why are you here?<br>
Open your eyes and answer me,<br>
why does your heart beat again?<br>
<br>
Your golden hair now is just ashes.<br>
Oh, angel, return with your kind,<br>
return if you can because<br>
I can already hear the drums.<br>
<br>
Here the breeze doesn't run,<br>
the one you're so used to.<br>
Oh, angel, breathe deeper,<br>
if your burden allows you to.<br>
<br>
You are so weak, angel,<br>
your chanting is barely heard.<br>
Oh, angel, scream and<br>
liberate yourself from your new chains.<br>
<br>
Didn't your wings use to fly?<br>
Didn't you protect me so many nights?<br>
How deep in lava are you right now?<br>
Float, levitate, make yourself a way to the new.<br>
<br>
Your eyes are now black, angel.<br>
Does your soul not rest now?<br>
Look around you, praise<br>
your new jail for your soul.<br>
<br>
Your voice is now hoarse.<br>
Oh, angel, save yourself from the dark,<br>
save yourself if you can because<br>
you don't follow your own steps now.<br>
<br>
You hardly breathe<br>
and now your halo is dark.<br>
You yell so loud, angel<br>
what an incredible ability!<br>
<br>
Run but the chains will imprison you.<br>
Run away but the arrows will catch you.<br>
Scream but the shadows will smother you.<br>
I invite you to try, angel.<br>
<br>
Don't sleep, my angel,<br>
don't let them catch you sleeping.<br>
It is then when they attack,<br>
the riders of the intenal apocalypse.<br>
<br>
I am sure you are very tired, angel.<br>
Here, have a cup of my blood.<br>
Didn't you use to take it away from me<br>
and now you are rejecting it?<br>
<br>
Admit it, you are dead, and<br>
in your heart only madness remains.<br>
Where does your God lie now?<br>
Was not his power the greatest?<br>
<br>
But worry not,<br>
you can already give me your trumpet.<br>
You will stop tormenting me,<br>
you will never reign my dreams anymore.<br>
<br>
You made me impure and<br>
that is what you will become, angel.<br>
Louder, scream louder!<br>
Make yours my contained fury!<br>
<br>
It consumes you, it is superior,<br>
isn't it so, my angel?<br>
Your skin isn't so smooth,<br>
nor your hair is so perfect.<br>
<br>
Nothing but your heart remains<br>
and even then, corrupt, it won't be removed.<br>
You will pay for the sins<br>
you were so eager to fight against.<br>
<br>
Suffer, suffer in front of me<br>
like I did in front of you.<br>
I will look in the distance<br>
like you did for me.<br>
<br>
I will wipe your tears<br>
but I won't give up on you.<br>
You promised me salvation,<br>
but you only gave me sin.<br>
<br>
Now it is I who wins,<br>
in this cold, cold and empty room.<br>
God bless your soul,<br>
he has not blessed mine.<br>
<br>
I will break your holy heart<br>
until it bleeds, it bleeds and dies.<br>
My hero, my legend,<br>
my fall, my death.<br>
<br>
Look at yourself, you are broken, angel,<br>
and broken toys are not<br>
liked by anybody.<br>
You are nothing but trash now.<br>
<br>
Look at yourself, you are crazy, angel,<br>
you do not know what you are saying,<br>
but I know very well how much you curse me,<br>
or didn't you see my luck?<br>
<br>
You died in my hands,<br>
I do npt need you anymore,<br>
now I am the owner of my destine,<br>
now you will not manipulate us anmore.<br>
<br>
You are gushing sweat, crying blood,<br>
you are miserable and you are agonizing.<br>
That is how you used to see me<br>
but you never did anything about it.<br>
<br>
Your cries are worhtless to me now,<br>
you only speak trash and tell deceits.<br>
My only angel is me,<br>
you last-longing impostor.<br>
<br>
Look how the destroyed souls<br>
of your friends are celebrating.<br>
Grey bodies in yellowish linen<br>
who sing and dance in circles.<br>
<br>
Wouldn't you like to join them?<br>
It is a shame, for you will stay<br>
with me and only with me.<br>
That's what you said in my childhood, traitor.<br>
<br>
Does not the melody of<br>
all of us kids who ever sang<br>
to you stay in your mind?<br>
Does it not ashame you?<br>
<br>
Rot, angel, rot<br>
in my soul! You will not escape.<br>
You will not hurt anyone<br>
else ever again.<br>
<br>
Your soul is sinking,<br>
and your heart barely pumps.<br>
Forever together, angel,<br>
forever together.<br>
<br>
Here, use your lyre,<br>
let me hear your voice.<br>
Sing to me one of these lullabies<br>
to calm the pain.<br>
<br>
Dead as you are sacred,<br>
agonizing as your God is high.<br>
Be born, come out of your chrysalis,<br>
fly, little angel, fly.<br>
<br>
Do you hear the roaring? It is them.<br>
They devoured my soul and<br>
they will not hesitate to come.<br>
You will feel them.<br>
<br>
They will chew on you<br>
until their teeth are numb.<br>
They will drink your poison<br>
as much as you perish.<br>
<br>
I am broken too.<br>
Look at me, stare at me.<br>
Deign to look at my eyes,<br>
your morbid creation.<br>
<br>
I will drag you, I will drag you<br>
until your face is no<br>
different from mine.<br>
You will not last, you will not last.<br>
<br>
Your chains are open, angel,<br>
let us see how do you walk,<br>
let us see how do you take vengeance<br>
if you do not obey me already.<br>
<br>
Sing to me in your celestial language,<br>
breathe your divine air.<br>
Purify your wounds,<br>
are you not free now?<br>
<br>
Look at me! I am your creation!<br>
I am your demon! You made me like this!<br>
Touch my horns! Do not feel pity!<br>
Oh, my poor angel, poor you.<br>
<br>
Get on your knees and pray to me,<br>
just as I did to you.<br>
Realize how useless<br>
where your healing prayers.<br>
<br>
Poison, they were poison<br>
that corrupted my soul<br>
and it will now corrupt<br>
your divine and sacred temple.<br>
<br>
Oh my angel, my hero,<br>
pardon my sins as you<br>
also pardoned the<br>
sinners who killed me.<br>
<br>
You are nothing but garbage,<br>
you are nothing but dust.<br>
Cough. Spit. Disappear.<br>
Die and never come again.<br>
</p>
