<p align="center">
i pronounced the forbidden words<br>
in front of your sacred altar,<br>
and now there was nobody who cared<br>
enough to stop me.<br>
<br>
shining, your door opened to me,<br>
and you appeared with firm steps.<br>
you came to where i was kneeling<br>
and reached out for me to go with you.<br>
<br>
behind us a portal opened,<br>
intense blue as your gaze,<br>
and as soon as we walked through it<br>
my feet started to levitate.<br>
<br>
in a world of teal fumes<br>
everything was surrounded by that substance.<br>
i couldn't believe what my eyes saw<br>
but you were by my side to guide me.<br>
<br>
it is then when you taught me that everything had an aura,<br>
and that if i concentrated enough, i would be able to read them,<br>
and know what i could read not only from people,<br>
but also from animals and objects that store memories.<br>
<br>
with a bit of effort i soon understood,<br>
and something inside me awakened.<br>
the chains that recluded some part of my body<br>
blew up like they had never existed.<br>
<br>
and then you put me back to earth,<br>
slowly, floating, and now everything had an aura:<br>
the hotel, the tourists, the street had something special<br>
which i had never noticed before.<br>
<br>
while i fell you gave me your signal<br>
and my power in the world of the mortals,<br>
you trusted that i would know how to use it<br>
in my daily life.<br>
<br>
and when i started to step on the street<br>
everything moved in slow motion around me,<br>
everything looked more sharp and full of life,<br>
like i had never seen it.<br>
<br>
it was the tears that woke me up<br>
of such nocturnal trance, and i'm still searching you<br>
in the hideouts of my mind,<br>
waiting to see you again.<br>
<br>
what are you?<br>
