<p align="center">
it is not my head<br>
it is not my body<br>
you are nothing<br>
you are nothing<br>
<br>
to how many years of prison<br>
did you convict my soul?<br>
why are you doing this<br>
if its wearing you out?<br>
<br>
i am not your master<br>
i am nothing<br>
i didnt want to admit<br>
but you are also here with me<br>
<br>
why wouldnt you<br>
let me see them?<br>
do you really hate me that much<br>
when i tried to love you?<br>
<br>
you looked like a copy<br>
a neglection of all my identity<br>
you looked barefoot<br>
and walking for the sake of it<br>
<br>
but i am going to put it all aside<br>
as long as you promise me two things<br>
that i will be let out<br>
and that we will let each other live<br>
<br>
i am willing to forgive you<br>
for so many years of slavery<br>
do not deny my existence<br>
because ive already come this far<br>
<br>
and its because someone talked to me<br>
for the first time in so many years<br>
they werent hurtful words<br>
and carried my true names<br>
<br>
i understand why youd want<br>
to repress me but youve taken it<br>
too far, please<br>
accept me just as i am<br>
<br>
but do not only accept me<br>
but also yourself<br>
we can fix it, i believe<br>
i reach our to you, i invite you<br>
<br>
sincerely,<br>
from Cristian to Dael<br>
</p>
