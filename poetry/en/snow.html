<p align="center">
It only snows when there is<br>
a reason to do so.<br>
It only rains when there is<br>
a path to be walked.<br>
<br>
What will it be of me<br>
when it does not rain again,<br>
when the forest stops growing,<br>
when I see the last leaf fall.<br>
<br>
We will all regret what we did not do<br>
and what we could do.<br>
What we did not avoid<br>
and what will make us perish.<br>
<br>
And when an animal eats<br>
from your hand you will tell me<br>
that you couldn't,<br>
that you had to kill them.<br>
<br>
And when a thunder falls<br>
over your garden you will tell me<br>
that you are cursed,<br>
that you are a saint.<br>
<br>
We turn into our progenitors<br>
and they turn into the dirt we walk.<br>
