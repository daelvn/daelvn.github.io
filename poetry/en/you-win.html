<p align="center">
you've got what you wanted.<br>
even though it's gone now,<br>
you know that you won<br>
in the depths of my mind.<br>
<br>
now with each passing day<br>
i crave more for interaction,<br>
but i'm being left alone<br>
by the people i used to trust.<br>
<br>
and that is when you made your move,<br>
in the moment i most need someone to talk,<br>
you creep in my mind,<br>
waiting for me to come back to you.<br>
<br>
a message so carefully crafted<br>
so you know i'd be back in barely a month<br>
even though your last messages<br>
would beg to differ.<br>
<br>
but you got rid of these too,<br>
don't worry, i got pictures<br>
to remind myself how much you really hate me<br>
before sending you the first message.<br>
<br>
so if you are reading my words<br>
i'll let you know that you won.<br>
i can't get you out of my mind<br>
and every night i'm at the border of messaging you.<br>
<br>
the onnly thing left stopping me<br>
are my few friends who know about this<br>
but it won't last long<br>
and my barriers are going to fall.<br>
<br>
is this what you really wanted?<br>
to see me suffer yet again?<br>
i had forgotten about you,<br>
i thought i had made it alive.<br>
<br>
but oh i was so wrong,<br>
little did i know you would come back<br>
to haunt me in all of my dreams,<br>
if i even get them anymore.<br>
<br>
you win.<br>
see you soon.<br>
<br>
</p>
