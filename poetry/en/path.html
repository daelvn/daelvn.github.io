<p align="center">
The path starts in education<br>
and the walkers are the children.<br>
The horizon has no limit<br>
and the sailor are the outlaws.<br>
<br>
More than injured rebels<br>
by the people who put them at shooting range.<br>
They may think, but they<br>
will never walk the path of oblivion.<br>
<br>
Child, put on your shoes,<br>
I will take you on a walk.<br>
If the parents don't do it,<br>
someone will have to educate them instead.<br>
<br>
Walk towards the beasts<br>
and stab them with your knife.<br>
If you don't do it,<br>
someone will have to save us instead.<br>
<br>
The miserable remains one<br>
if nobody lets them walk.<br>
Let them silence us, let them silence us,<br>
we will start to shout.<br>
<br>
Walker, there's always a way<br>
as long as you make it be seen.<br>
Walker, guide your steps<br>
since in ten years we will perish.<br>
<br>
What is an unread book<br>
but a pile of paper?<br>
What is a forest without trees<br>
but a place to build?<br>
<br>
History repeats itself<br>
because they want it to repeat.<br>
These cries repeat themselves<br>
because nobody else cries for Earth.<br>
<br>
Walk towards the beasts<br>
and someday you will come back.<br>
