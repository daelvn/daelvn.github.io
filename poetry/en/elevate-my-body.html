<p align="center">
elevate my body<br>
float me to the moon<br>
i did all that i wanted<br>
and i am ready to go<br>
<br>
i was born to the moonlight<br>
and when we first met Him.<br>
now i will turn into light<br>
and reunite with my satellite<br>
<br>
elevate my body<br>
as i grow wings<br>
and become what i once destroyed<br>
it cannot be helped<br>
<br>
golden shards float around me<br>
and form the halo that will<br>
be my window back to life.<br>
i am ready to go.<br>
<br>
elevate my body<br>
as the bells ring,<br>
as the piano plays,<br>
as the music box sounds.<br>
<br>
my lifeless corpse turns into the fog<br>
that covers the mountains of this land.<br>
my last tears turn into the rivers<br>
that feed into the neverending sea.<br>
<br>
elevate my body<br>
i will breathe in peace<br>
i can feel how i disintegrate<br>
and my energy goes back to earth<br>
<br>
i am creation and i paid my debt<br>
nothing but my heart remains<br>
when i observe from the clouds<br>
what i used to call my home<br>
<br>
elevate my body<br>
as i leave this forest<br>
i have no reason to be sad<br>
it is how i wanted to go, after all<br>
<br>
my emotions feed into the stardust<br>
that makes the universe look as it does.<br>
it will carry on even if<br>
i already consumed my last breath<br>
<br>
elevate my body<br>
as i prepare to reign the skies<br>
i am my own god<br>
i have always been<br>
<br>
i will place my translucent feet<br>
on the clouds up above<br>
but my hair will reach for<br>
the stars millions of miles away<br>
<br>
elevate my body<br>
as the Third waves goodbye<br>
i know i have made someone happy<br>
while i was in life<br>
<br>
i will use my quill<br>
to tell the tales of the angel<br>
that once walked the earth<br>
to learn to be impure<br>
<br>
there's nothing left now<br>
my body might be buried<br>
but my soul will stay up here<br>
waving welcome to anyone who thinks of them<br>
<br>
oh, what have i left in earth,<br>
nothing but my fading memory.<br>
my fate is with the stars<br>
as it always should have been.<br>
<br>
because i have turned into my progenitors<br>
and into the land they walked.<br>
