<p align="center">
I am scared when I look in the mirror<br>
because I do not see myself.<br>
Please, somebody tell me<br>
what kind of monster have I become.<br>
<br>
It feels like my body is not mine<br>
and I do not recognize any of its<br>
shapes in the dark of the night.<br>
Please, somebody tell me who am I.<br>
<br>
You are the true master<br>
of the play, who controls all<br>
the help that I received,<br>
but your light is even darker than mine.<br>
<br>
Why did the gods gave wrath<br>
to these that hate violence?<br>
Do they wish to presence<br>
my divine self-destruction so much?<br>
<br>
Let me drink your blood<br>
and kill me once for all.<br>
Save me in your dead life.<br>
New blood, new blood.<br>
<br>
Make me of your kind,<br>
and let me descend,<br>
because here the stars shine so bright<br>
I can't see myself.<br>
<br>
Tell them to stop covering my eyes,<br>
they only want to smother me.<br>
Please, reveal it to me,<br>
I must be alive for something else.<br>
<br>
New blood, new blood,<br>
I only want to live<br>
so it can rain again.<br>
I do put my faith in you.<br>
<br>
They are who manipulate me,<br>
they use me as a window<br>
and through it they make me kneel.<br>
Make it stop, make it stop.<br>
<br>
They take control of my body<br>
and with it they control me,<br>
with it they hurt me.<br>
Make it stop, make it stop.<br>
<br>
Master, I know that I am dying,<br>
you do not need to hide it,<br>
but I only ask you to save me,<br>
once again, from this situation.<br>
<br>
Hold my hand during<br>
the last breath of my life.<br>
You were born with me and you will go with me:<br>
the blessing of he who opens portals.<br>
<br>
Let me drink your blood<br>
so I may go with you,<br>
meet with my true progenitor.<br>
New blood, new blood.<br>
<br>
I want to hurt it<br>
and I want it to hurt.<br>
</p>
