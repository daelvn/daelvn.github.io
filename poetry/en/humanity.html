<p align="center">
Humanity is a convention</p>
none of us agreed to.</p>
Look at my face and tell me</p>
whether I am some kind of defaced monster.</p>
</p>
Stare at my lifeless gaze and tell me</p>
what is inside of me,</p>
if there is,</p>
and if there is, whether you call it human.</p>
</p>
What is being human but</p>
a set of rules,</p>
of prejudices, of conventions</p>
that they say we have to follow?</p>
</p>
What does it mean to be a person?</p>
Who says so?</p>
How much do they reign over my soul</p>
to tell me so?</p>
</p>
It is a big deceit,</p>
a deception,</p>
they only dehumanize</p>
when they feel they have to.</p>
</p>
But they all were human,</p>
the murderers and the genocidal,</p>
and at the same time none of us is,</p>
only because they say so.</p>
</p>
Then I am not human,</p>
I refuse, I will not bow down,</p>
anything but that.</p>
You won't hear me say I'm human.</p>
</p>
I say I have wings</p>
but that you can't see them.</p>
I say I have fangs</p>
but that I won't bite you.</p>
</p>
Feel my breeze,</p>
feel the power</p>
of having the domain of oneself</p>
and not get lost.</p>
</p>
Because I am like a wolf to people</p>
and people are like wolves to me.</p>
