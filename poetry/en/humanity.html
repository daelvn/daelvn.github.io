<p align="center">
Humanity is a convention<br>
none of us agreed to.<br>
Look at my face and tell me<br>
whether I am some kind of defaced monster.<br>
<br>
Stare at my lifeless gaze and tell me<br>
what is inside of me,<br>
if there is,<br>
and if there is, whether you call it human.<br>
<br>
What is being human but<br>
a set of rules,<br>
of prejudices, of conventions<br>
that they say we have to follow?<br>
<br>
What does it mean to be a person?<br>
Who says so?<br>
How much do they reign over my soul<br>
to tell me so?<br>
<br>
It is a big deceit,<br>
a deception,<br>
they only dehumanize<br>
when they feel they have to.<br>
<br>
But they all were human,<br>
the murderers and the genocidal,<br>
and at the same time none of us is,<br>
only because they say so.<br>
<br>
Then I am not human,<br>
I refuse, I will not bow down,<br>
anything but that.<br>
You won't hear me say I'm human.<br>
<br>
I say I have wings<br>
but that you can't see them.<br>
I say I have fangs<br>
but that I won't bite you.<br>
<br>
Feel my breeze,<br>
feel the power<br>
of having the domain of oneself<br>
and not get lost.<br>
<br>
Because I am like a wolf to people<br>
and people are like wolves to me.<br>
