<p align="center">
a pencil is all you need<br>
to start a revolution.<br>
two people, all you need<br>
to share an emotion.<br>
<br>
the sea is not deep<br>
if you only float in it.<br>
nobody is going to complain<br>
as long as they get well fed.<br>
<br>
what you see nor what you hear<br>
can be trusted, you don't know it.<br>
there's more than one perspective,<br>
and some take it to their deathplace.<br>
<br>
if you wake up and seeing hurts,<br>
don't stop seeing, improve what you see.<br>
an empty hand doesn't give warmth<br>
but it's better if it's more than a hundred.<br>
<br>
i share my message,<br>
i leave myself in debt,<br>
to give that warmth<br>
to the people surrounded by ice.<br>
<br>
what we create is a mirror<br>
that reflects reality just as<br>
we see it,<br>
and i have many.<br>
<br>
if you are like me, free,<br>
and don't adhere to conventional rules.<br>
you understand this message as a whole.<br>
you might be like me but always you.<br>
<br>
and if the kids don't know<br>
that we're there for them<br>
they will have to start from scratch,<br>
suffering and from the beginning.<br>
<br>
a pencil is all you need<br>
to start a revolution.<br>
