<p align="center">
here lies my gravestone,<br>
humid and mossy, forgotten.<br>
its body is already empty,<br>
there is nothing left.<br>
<br>
my hands feed into the forest<br>
beside me, eternally.<br>
my neck makes the water of the stream<br>
move much strongly.<br>
<br>
i do not exist corporeally anymore,<br>
but i do exist in the trees,<br>
i do exist in the clouds<br>
and in the lake.<br>
<br>
i exist in the rain,<br>
i exist in other minds,<br>
in other gravestones,<br>
i will always exist.<br>
<br>
and when the earth<br>
consumes its last breath,<br>
i know i will be part of a star,<br>
i will turn into its core and its light<br>
<br>
and if there is life out there,<br>
and they look into the constellation my star forms,<br>
my light will reach them, i will exist with them,<br>
because it travels infinitely without stopping.<br>
<br>
and the person that puts their gaze in me<br>
will know i am with them, that they have my strength.<br>
i will build my legacy for the eternal<br>
and not for the ephimeral.<br>
<br>
leaving a trace in life is useless for me,<br>
the only infinite things are stars,<br>
who will welcome me among them<br>
as just another sibling.<br>
<br>
and the cycle will continue forever,<br>
as long as the sky has stars<br>
and there is someone to watch them<br>
as someone looks at their lover.<br>
<br>
and you?<br>
have you looked at the stars today?<br>
