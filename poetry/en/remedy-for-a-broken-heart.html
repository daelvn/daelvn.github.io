<p align="center">
a lie and an "i love you",<br>
regardless of the order.<br>
a heart and a promise,<br>
that end up broken.<br>
<br>
<strong>i tried to be perfect</strong>,<br>
but im never enough,<br>
i want to give all that is in me,<br>
but it never works<br>
<br>
i tried to heal your cracks,<br>
that they left behind, convince you<br>
that nothing was wrong,<br>
but i couldn't hold it in<br>
<br>
i can feel your stare,<br>
behind any screen,<br>
i can feel your depth,<br>
that black that consumes me<br>
<br>
and i feel at the border of a cliff,<br>
i know that if i keep looking,<br>
i will fall,<br>
and otherwise, you will.<br>
<br>
i tried to sacrifice myself,<br>
here i am and so i did,<br>
i fell backwards,<br>
sustaining the stare.<br>
<br>
and i fell for the same problems<br>
that i warned you about<br>
and i fell in the same tricks<br>
from which i tried to protect you<br>
<br>
i came down to be able to understand you better,<br>
to get close even if distant,<br>
to calm you even if irrelevant,<br>
because i really care<br>
<br>
but only two kinds of people understand your problems:<br>
those who have your eyes,<br>
and those who you killed with your eyes,<br>
those who you killed<br>
<br>
im not the only one<br>
in this abyss,<br>
people that i almost don't<br>
get to understand<br>
<br>
you saw me fall and i asked you to turn around,<br>
now i dont see you and darkness consumes my eyes.<br>
the spiderweb consumes my mind,<br>
ensuring the most absolute collapse of my state.<br>
<br>
<strong>so many things that i promised</strong><br>
that you knew i was incapable of fulfilling,<br>
for a reason or another,<br>
i cant be happy<br>
<br>
many things that i told you,<br>
that i now regret,<br>
and now that you're free<br>
you remember me with bitterness<br>
<br>
now im just one of them,<br>
someone you thought understood you,<br>
but i lied in so many things,<br>
that i got rid of reality completely<br>
<br>
broken heart for no reason,<br>
i lost it all for losing one thing,<br>
i wasted it all for wasting your love,<br>
but i cant accept it<br>
<br>
i ask you to follow your heart,<br>
because it is still full of light,<br>
it still has wings to fly,<br>
and i cant hold it anymore<br>
<br>
<strong>time for you to get rid of me</strong>,<br>
time for you to bury me by your tomb,<br>
time for you to look at me for the last time,<br>
time for you to say that it's all over<br>
<br>
i know how many they were and now im only<br>
a number,<br>
another person that allowed themselves to hurt you,<br>
even when they didn't recognize it<br>
<br>
i was stupid, selfish,<br>
i didnt believe to be the light that really guides you,<br>
but now you move on,<br>
and i lie in my deathplace<br>
<br>
time for you to forget me,<br>
time for your darkness to consume my eyes,<br>
time for your problems to be mine,<br>
time for your songs to sing my cries<br>
<br>
i had many attempts,<br>
and i didnt use any of them.<br>
people that mattered to me,<br>
who i would end up destroying<br>
<br>
and i know you two tried to ignore it,<br>
now i know that nothing was true,<br>
that it really hurt,<br>
that you want to forget.<br>
<br>
i dont know whether i should move on,<br>
or return to my roots.<br>
whether i should continue,<br>
or face my ghosts.<br>
<br>
<strong>hate me</strong>, step on me,<br>
dont remember me as someone who saved you,<br>
break me, destroy me,<br>
dont have me as someone kind-hearted<br>
<br>
i dont know if im able to hold someone<br>
without hurting them.<br>
i make myself believe not and so<br>
i get into this abyss alone.<br>
<br>
spit on me, laugh<br>
at the youth we suffer.<br>
forget, confess,<br>
whether you really felt something.<br>
<br>
i cant believe that in some years<br>
you will only be a memory of my childhood,<br>
of my useless attempts<br>
of being who i am not<br>
<br>
<strong>a love that is not corresponded</strong>,<br>
is what i made you suffer from,<br>
now i pay the price,<br>
with your own sufferment.<br>
<br>
i break, i decay, i decompose and i break down,<br>
many things that i promised,<br>
many things that wont come true,<br>
many false hopes that i gave you<br>
<br>
only for my future to repeat these errors,<br>
for my person to hate themselves,<br>
for my body to unappreciate itself,<br>
for my soul to rebel<br>
<br>
<strong>a remedy for a broken heart</strong>,<br>
i would wish to give you so that you can ban me from it,<br>
and the only solution,<br>
is to break mine<br>
