<p align="center">
Tell me how far<br>
I am from your head.<br>
Tell me how far<br>
you are from loving me.<br>
<br>
So many nights<br>
building my castles.<br>
So many fights<br>
going on in my mind.<br>
<br>
I don't understand<br>
why I can't love you.<br>
Maybe I do,<br>
but I don't accept it.<br>
<br>
How can I really be so na√Øve?<br>
How could I really do this to me?<br>
Tell me why, tell me why.<br>
<br>
And I would move the stars,<br>
I would arrange the sky<br>
for us<br>
to constellate.<br>
<br>
And I would be so proud<br>
to die on your way.<br>
A fake illusion,<br>
to constellate.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I don't get it at all.<br>
Perhaps I don't know what's going on.<br>
In the sky. In our sky.<br>
<br>
// Because it's a pleasure to share //<br>
// and to constellate //<br>
</p>
