<p align="center">
a night was worth ten<br>
you pulled me close and left me hanging<br>
wanted more but you were gone<br>
<br>
nothing in return and i watched the look in your eyes<br>
while i put my eyes on you<br>
but yours shined for another star<br>
<br>
i didnt realize and soon i fell<br>
you caught me in your net and i cant get out<br>
but you have no part for me<br>
<br>
im sorry if i smothered you<br>
sometimes i wish<br>
iâ€™d never been born<br>
