often we take the concept of humanity for granted, we usually think we know what it is all about. but sometimes you gotta ask yourself beyond that, it is not only a matter of existence, it is also a matter of autonomy and a matter of rulings. i like to think of the concept of "humanity" as you might think of sex and gender. we want it or not, we are born with a certain sex, doesn't have to be two, and then a gender is (eugh) assigned at you based on that.<br>
<br>
gender is all about what society makes of sex, it has a set of "commonly accepted" rules that you are expected to follow simply for being born with certain genitalia. nowadays, i've been able to find myself in a supportive and accepting community that encourages me to push the boundaries of gender and break with the concept of it, it is one of the many reasons i'm non-binary (apart from certain kinds of dysphoria). now, how does all of this relate to being human or not?<br>
<br>
well we have to set the difference between being human and humanity. i'll assume that most of the readers are born Homo Sapiens, pretty rad if you aren't, and that's well, biological. you might be able to change that with a good doctor and a lot of money but it isn't something you usually change. now, when you are born, a certain set of expectations are automatically assigned to you as a "human", that's "humanity".<br>
<br>
i've expressed this discontent in some of my poems. who says what is human and what is not? is it really? how much do those people reign over my soul to tell me? the thing is, it's all a convention that we didn't agree to, just like you might not agree with the gender assigned to you. rejecting labels doesn't work for everybody, we should always be aware of that, but for those of us that work, i think there's something liberating to it.<br>
<br>
it isn't something i've explicitly got into, i'm not as experienced or well-versed in this as someone kin/therian/in other communities, and i can only talk from my "philosophical", if you can call it that, point of view. you don't have to always do as you're told. you can reject your humanity, and you can play by your own rules. if society defined what is to being human, why wouldn't you be able to define what is it to be like you?<br>
<br>
i think it's about being able to define ourselves however we want to, and escape from this concept of "that's inhumane", or "that's something very human", it is all dictated by a society which will have high expectations from you, and guess what, you don't always have to meet them. i'm open to other points of view, but this is generally how i think of someone when they tell me they aren't simply human.<br>
<br>
you know what? older generations in western culture have been caring for long enough, it's time that we start not caring about it, i think it's time to give us the right to self-determination. so what if i say i'm not human? if i want, i can. it's about putting yourself first, because you matter too. it's time we ditch the concept of humanity and start playing by the rules we're comfortable playing. it doesn't have to be the same rules for everyone, because all of us are different.<br>
<br>
so when i'm in my close group of friends, i like to say that i have no known gender and that i don't want to call myself a human. perhaps the others are fine with being human, but i've been meeting others' expectations for too long, and it's about time i start doing what i feel most comfortable with. my friends generally accept this, and thanks to my poems they've been able to understand what's it like to feel like this.<br>
<br>
so to close off, i'm going to sum up in a very simple way: be you, do whatever you want, you play by your own rules and you are not obligated to meet anybody's expectations on what you should and shouldn't be. defy all boundaries and conventions. you are the only person that can define yourself, and it is very important that we acknowledge that. if someone else wants to express their POV, i'm currently very interested in it and would love to know more! that's all.<br>
