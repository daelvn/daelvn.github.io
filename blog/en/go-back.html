sometimes i wonder whether i<br>
could repeat it all again,<br>
fix everything, be better,<br>
help others, help myself<br>
<br>
but then i realize that,<br>
perhaps it was fine like that,<br>
perhaps i really did what i could,<br>
it ended like it had to end.<br>
<br>
people don't acknowledge during their lives<br>
hat they're really doing the best they can,<br>
with the tools that they have.<br>
it's ok if it couldn't have been more.<br>
<br>
:: you're doing ok, i promise ::<br>
:: it's fine like that ::<br>
:: you did what you could ::<br>
:: to whoever's reading this, i'm with you, ok? ::<br>
